# REST API documentation 

# HTTP Methods 

* `GET` - get a resource from the server
* `POST` - post a resource to the server (create or append)
* `PUT` - put a resource on the server (create or overwrite)
* `PATCH` - update parts of an existing resource on the server
* `DELETE` - delete a resource 
* `OPTIONS` - determine whether follow-up/ next request is allowed (sent automatically)


# Rest Principles 

* Uniform Interface - clearly defined api endpoints with clearly defined requests + response data structure 
* Stateless Interactions - server and cliend dont store any connection history, every request is handled seperately
